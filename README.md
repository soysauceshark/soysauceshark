- 👋 Hi, I’m Sharlene!
- 👀 I’m interested in linguistics, sharks, crochet, matcha, running, baking, reading, and of course, coding. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ in college and trying to self-learn full-stack development :)  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something for first timers as I've never contributed before. 
- 📫 How to reach me: sharlenechen7@gmail.com
